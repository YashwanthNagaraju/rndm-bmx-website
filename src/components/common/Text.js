      </Heading>
      <BodyText>
        rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”) is committed to ensuring the privacy and
        security of all information collected from our customers, potential
        customers and any other persons we deal with.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy outlines the information collection practices
        utilized by rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”), how that information is used and
        the choices you can make about the way the information you provide to us
        is collected and used.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The information we collect</b>
        <br />
        When you lodge an enquiry with or submit an order to rndm-bmx.com
        (“RNDM-BMX”) via our websites, or by any other method, we may collect
        information about you in order to enable us to complete our sales
        transaction or to provide information about our products or our company
        or to service your request. This information includes, but is not
        limited to, your personal information such as your name, your contact
        details, your purchase or enquiries and relevant business and financial
        information. We may not be able to serve you fully if you do not supply
        the information.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information
        we collect from you is accurate, up to date and complete and that when
        we use or disclose that information it remains accurate, up to date and
        complete. If you request that we correct or change information that we
        have previously provided to third parties, then we may do so provided it
        is reasonable and practicable to do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you are not purchasing products from rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”) you
        have the option of not identifying yourself or alternatively you can use
        a pseudonym for instance, when you ask for a catalogue of our products
        or product information. However the use of a pseudonym might not always
        be practicable as it may make it difficult for us to forward such
        information without your name, being made available to us.
        <br />
        <br />
        rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”) does not receive unsolicited personal
        information about you from any third parties. Further we do not collect
        any sensitive information about you such as information about your
        political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual preferences or about your
        health. Lastly we do not adopt any government related identifiers in
        order to identify you. For example your personal income tax number.
        <br />
        <br />
        If we were to collect your personal information from someone other than
        you, we will notify you that such information has been collected and the
        circumstances of that collection.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”) web site</b>

        Like most web sites, there is certain information we automatically track
        when you use rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”) website, including the URL that

        is utilized to improve how rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”) responds to your
        queries and purchase requirements and does not include any personally
        identifying information. We will not retain any such information unless
        you submit that information for our response or other transactional
        purposes.

        <br />
        This policy does not apply to other third party websites which you

        <b>How we use the information</b>

        provide its products and product information to you or to service any
        other request you may have. It may also be used for other purposes which
        you would reasonably expect, for example, for research, staff training,
        planning or for supply to third party service providers such as mailing
        houses that we use to send you surface post material, third party
        clearance houses, share registries or mercantile agents for account
        settlement.

        As a customer or potential customer of rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”)

        Unless otherwise prohibited by law, we may disclose personal information
        if required to do so by law, court order, or as requested by a
        governmental or law enforcement authority. Such situations may include
        to protect the rights or properties of rndm-bmx.com (“RNDM-BMX”) or when
        we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary
        to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be
        causing, or who may be threatening to cause, interference with or damage
        to our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise; or when
        anyone else could be harmed by such activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not disclose your personal information to any overseas recipients.
